$t725;#1 Obtain the red key and open the door in the north-west area.  The key is found to the south of the door in the metal area with criss-crossing paths.  Ride up the lift and jump to the south.  Next walk along the wall on the very small ledges until you are near the south-east end of the room.  Push the switch that appears and jump onto the platform above the red key.  Ride the platform up and run west into the wall.  The wall will open and allow you to ride a lift back to the roof platform.  Quickly jump south to the armor bonuses.  Shoot the switch that appears to the north, but do not ride up the platform again.  Wait for the platform to rise and then jump down to obtain the red key.  To reach the red  door, return to the north-western crate room.  There is a switch that lowers a platform near the doorway to the crate room.  Push the switch and quickly jump from crate to crate until you can head south-west above the doorway and land on the platform.  Ride the platform up to the red door.
